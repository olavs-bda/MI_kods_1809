## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### Core Concept

ACCOUNTALIST transforms procrastination into productivity by escalating missed tasks to chosen contacts (friends, family, boss, ex) - creating real social consequences that drive follow-through.

### Key Differentiators

- **Real Stakes**: Social consequences vs meaningless gamification
- **Viral by Design**: Story-worthy experiences drive organic growth
- **Privacy-First**: Transparent consent and control systems
- **Reliability-Focused**: 99%+ escalation delivery success rate

### MVP Timeline

10-week roadmap from foundation setup to launch preparation:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Next.js + Supabase setup, authentication, basic UI
- **Weeks 3-4**: Task management, contact system, escalation policies
- **Weeks 5-6**: Escalation engine, React email templates, delivery pipeline
- **Weeks 7-8**: Viral onboarding, social sharing, mobile optimization
- **Weeks 9-10**: Premium features, reliability audit, launch preparation

### Technical Priorities

1. **Escalation System Reliability**: The core value proposition cannot fail
2. **Mobile-First Performance**: Sub-2-second load times for task management
3. **Privacy & Security**: GDPR compliance, RLS policies, encrypted data
4. **Viral UX**: Screenshot-ready design optimized for social sharing
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Migration path from MVP to enterprise scale

## ðŸš€ Development Quick Start

### Key Technologies

```bash
# Core stack
Next.js 15 + App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
Resend (React Email templates)
Vercel (Deployment + Edge Functions)

# Development setup
npm create next-app@latest accountalist --typescript --tailwind --app
npm install @supabase/supabase-js resend react-email
npm install -D @types/node jest playwright
```

### Critical Implementation Notes
