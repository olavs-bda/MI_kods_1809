- **R003**: System supports task categorization and filtering by status, priority, and due date
- **R004**: Tasks display time remaining until deadline with visual urgency indicators
- **R005**: Users can set custom escalation policies per task (which contacts, timing, message intensity)

### Contact Management & Social Stakes System

- **R006**: Users can add shame contacts with relationship types (friend, partner, parent, boss, ex)
- **R007**: System sends consent verification requests to all added contacts before activation
- **R008**: Contacts can view their consent status and opt-out at any time
- **R009**: Users can organize contacts into escalation tiers (gentle → moderate → maximum shame)
- **R010**: System maintains contact privacy with secure, encrypted storage of personal information

### Escalation Engine - Core Differentiator

- **R011**: System automatically detects overdue tasks and initiates escalation sequences
- **R012**: Three-tier escalation flow: Private reminders → Light partner nudge → Heavy shame contact notification
- **R013**: Escalation timing is user-configurable with intelligent defaults (15min → 1hr → 4hr)
- **R014**: Each escalation level has contextually appropriate messaging templates
- **R015**: System cancels pending escalations immediately when tasks are marked complete
- **R016**: Failed escalation deliveries trigger backup notification methods and retry logic

### Notification & Messaging Infrastructure

- **R017**: System sends notifications via multiple channels: Email, SMS, push notifications
- **R018**: Message templates dynamically adapt based on task type, relationship, and escalation tier
- **R019**: All outbound messages include clear context, opt-out options, and sender identification
- **R020**: System tracks delivery confirmations and read receipts for all escalation messages
- **R021**: Rate limiting prevents spam and abuse of the escalation system
