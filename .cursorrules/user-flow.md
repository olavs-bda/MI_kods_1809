## Primary User Journey: The Complete Accountability Experience

### User Persona: Alex, The Procrastinating Professional

- **Background**: 28-year-old marketing manager who struggles with deadlines
- **Pain Points**: Constantly misses personal goals, disappoints themselves, lacks external pressure
- **Motivations**: Wants real consequences, values relationships, social media active
- **Goals**: Complete important tasks, build better habits, maintain relationships while getting accountability

---

## Journey Phase 1: Discovery & Initial Interest

### Touch Point 1: Social Media Discovery

**Context**: Alex sees viral TikTok/Reel: "This app texted my mom when I missed my workout 😅"

**User Experience Flow**:

```
Social Media Content → Curiosity → App Store Visit → Landing Page
```

- Easy transition from social media to app download
- Landing page immediately explains the concept with examples

**User Thoughts**:

- "Wait, this app actually texts your family when you fail?"
- "That's either genius or terrifying... probably both"
- "I wonder if this would actually make me stick to my goals"

**Conversion Actions**:

- Clicks "Download App" or "Get Started"
- Downloads app from App Store/Play Store
- Opens app for first time

## Journey Phase 2: Onboarding & Commitment Ritual

### Touch Point 2: Welcome & Value Proposition

```
Simple 3-step process:
1. Create task with deadline ⏰
2. Pick your "shame contacts" 😅
3. Complete task or face social consequences 📱

[Allow Contact Access] [Enter Manually]
```

```
✋ CONSENT REQUIRED

Before anyone can receive shame notifications:
- We'll send each contact a consent email
- They must agree to be your accountability partner

- Full transparency - they see what they'll receive

Sending consent emails to:
📧 Sarah Johnson - Sent ✓

## Edge Cases & Error Handling Flows

### Error Flow 1: Contact Doesn't Consent

**Context**: Shame contact declines to participate

**User Experience**:

```
Contact Consent → Declined Response → User Notification → Alternative Solutions
```

**User sees**:

```
😔 SARAH DECLINED ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNERSHIP

Sarah (sarah@email.com) declined to receive your accountability notifications.

This might mean:
• They're not comfortable with the responsibility
• They don't understand the system well enough
• They're going through a busy period

Your options:
1️⃣ [Invite Different Contact] - Choose someone else
2️⃣ [Send Explanation] - Help Sarah understand better
3️⃣ [Continue with Remaining Contacts] - Emma and Mom still active
4️⃣ [Adjust Escalation Levels] - Make tasks lower stakes

[Choose Option] [Get Help]
```

### Error Flow 2: Message Delivery Failure

**Context**: Escalation notification fails to deliver

**User Experience**:

```
Delivery Failure → Automatic Retry → Backup Method → User Notification → Resolution
```

**User sees**:

```
⚠️ DELIVERY ISSUE

Your escalation to Sarah failed to deliver:
📱 SMS to +1-555-0123 - "Number not in service"

We automatically tried:
✅ Backup email sent successfully
✅ Push notification sent to Sarah's app

Your accountability is still active! Sarah has been notified through backup channels.

Want to update Sarah's contact info?
[Update Phone Number] [Use Email Only] [Keep Current]
```

### Error Flow 3: User Wants to Cancel Escalation Last-Minute

**Context**: User realizes they need more time or made mistake

**User Experience**:

```
Panic Moment → Emergency Options → Consequence Explanation → Final Confirmation
```

**User sees**:

```
🚨 EMERGENCY ESCALATION CANCELLATION

Your "Finish project proposal" task escalation is about to fire in 3 minutes.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This defeats the purpose of accountability

Emergency options:
1️⃣ [Extend Deadline by 2 Hours] - Reschedule escalation
2️⃣ [Mark Task Complete] - If you actually finished it
3️⃣ [Cancel All Escalations] - ⚠️ This undermines your accountability

If you cancel:
❌ Contacts won't be notified this time
❌ Task marked as "accountability cancelled"
❌ This counts against your commitment streak
❌ Reduces effectiveness of future escalations

[Extend Deadline] [Mark Complete] [Emergency Cancel]
```
