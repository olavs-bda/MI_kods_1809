# ACCOUNTALIST – Social Accountability Through High-Stakes To-Do Management

## The Only To-Do App with Real Teeth

**One-Liner:** AccountaList transforms procrastination into productivity by escalating missed tasks to the people you least want to disappoint—making follow-through inevitable through social stakes.

**Executive Summary:**
AccountaList solves the fundamental problem that self-imposed consequences are too weak to overcome procrastination. Traditional to-do apps rely on gentle reminders and gamification, but they lack real stakes. People need external pressure tied to relationships they actually care about. Our app creates an escalating accountability system where missed tasks trigger notifications to chosen contacts—from light partner nudges to uncomfortable notifications to your mom, boss, or even your ex. Unlike other productivity tools that rely on internal motivation, AccountaList leverages loss aversion and social pressure to create maximum follow-through. The app is designed for viral growth through its inherent shareability—clips of "this app texted my mom when I missed my workout" are naturally meme-worthy and drive organic adoption.

**Tagline:** _The only to-do app where missing a task actually hurts._
